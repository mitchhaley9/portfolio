        <h3>Turf Tool</h3>
        
        <p>This project was my senior project for my CIS degree. I took this class the Spring of 2020</p>
        <p>The idea behind it was to create a tool for Golf course Superintendents to easily assign tasks to employees. Since I've worked at golf courses
            for 4 years, I noticed the problem of the superintendents needing to write a bunch of tasks on a white board every morning.
        </p>
        <p>By making an easy-to-use drag-and-drop task assigner, this tool solved the problem.</p>

<p>I used code from a pluggable components repository to accomplish the Trello-like application. And used a pluggable weather component for the weather bar.</p>
   
<p>While it's not the best looking/functioning application. It taught me a lot about how to break down a project into small pieces and how to be resourcful and motivated.</p>
